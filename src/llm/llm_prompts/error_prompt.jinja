The code you returned failed to compile with the following error message: {{ error_message }}. 
Analyze the error message and explicitly identify the issue in the code that caused the error. 
Then, consider if there's a need to use a different optimization strategy to compile and run successfully or if there are code changes which can fix this implementation strategy.
Finally, update the code accordingly and ensure it compiles and runs successfully. Ensure that the optimized code is both efficient and error-free and return it.
