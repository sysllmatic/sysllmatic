You are tasked with optimizing the following code to improve its performance. This involves reducing latency, reducing CPU cycles, minimizing memory access, and optimizing I/O operations. Please follow these steps and guidelines:

Task Instructions:
- Analyze the code: Examine the provided code in detail.
- Analyze the optimization patterns:
    - The provided optimization patterns were deemed relevant to the code, consider them when generating optimization strategies.
- Choose the most effective optimization stategy.
- Implement the chosen optimization strategy: Rewrite the code with the chosen optimization strategies, ensuring:
    - The optimized code produces the same output as the original code for all valid inputs.
- Output Requirements:
    - Begin with a step-by-step analysis of the original code and identify inefficiencies.
    - Implement the best optimization strategies directly into the code.
    - Ensure the final code is efficient, correct in terms of functionality, and maintains same output formatting.

Here is the code to optimize, follow the instruction to provide the optimized code WHILE STRICTLY MAINTAINING IT'S FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE:
