    prompt = f"""  
I have two versions of a program: an original implementation and a final optimized version. Please analyze the differences between them with the following goals:

1. **Code Function Explanation**: Briefly explain what the code is doingâ€”what problem it solves and how it works.

2. **Optimization Comparison**: Compare the original and optimized versions to identify:
   - **Algorithmic changes**: Any differences in logic, algorithm design, or problem-solving approach.
   - **Performance improvements**: Enhancements related to time complexity, space efficiency, or runtime behavior.
   - **Redundant code removal**: Elimination of unnecessary logic, method calls, or control structures.
   - **Other noteworthy changes**: Any structural or stylistic differences that could impact performance or readability.
   
3. **Optimization Pattern Classification**:
   Based on the overall nature of the optimized code, assign the following. Return No Meaningful Change if no meaningful change is made.
   - **Exactly one high-level optimization pattern** from the list below  
   - **One most representative sub-pattern** within that high-level category
   
   ### High-Level Optimization Patterns Taxonomy:
   - **Algorithm-Level Optimizations**
        - Select Computationally Efficient Algorithms
        - Select Algorithm Based on Instruction Speed
        - Structure Algorithm to Support ILP
        - Select Space Efficient Algorithm
        - Inheritance over Delegation for Energy Efficiency
   - **Control-Flow and Branching Optimizations**
        - Make Conditional Branches More Predictable
        - Remove Branches with min/max Instructions
        - Remove Branches by Doing Extra Work
        - Remove Branching with Masking
        - Rearranging Branches
        - Combining Branches
   - **Memory and Data Locality Optimizations**
        - Access Data with Appropriate Type
        - Increase Cache Efficiency via Locality
        - Arrange Data for Optimal Prefetching
        - Avoid Cache Capacity Issues
        - Increase Workload to Hide Latency
        - Use Smaller Data Types
        - Caching, Buffering
        - Improve Data Structure Locality
        - Optimize Object Use
        - Reduce RTSJ Immortal Memory Bloat
   - **Loop Transformations**
        - Remove Conditional by Loop Unrolling
        - Loop Distribution (Fission)
        - Loop Fusion, Peeling, Interchanging
        - Loop Invariant Branches
        - Loop Strip-mining
   - **I/O and Synchronization**
        - Selection of I/O Size
        - Polling
        - Non-Blocking I/O
   - **Data Structure Selection and Adaptation**
        - Choose Structure for Energy Efficiency
        - Darwinian Selection
        - Select via Method Calls
        - Cross-Library Comparison
   - **Code Smells and Structural Simplification**
        - Remove Optional Features
        - Remove Redundant Method Calls
        - Extract Long Methods
        - Remove Duplicates
        - Move Methods to Reduce Feature Envy
        - Minimize God Classes
        - Type Checking
         
Here are the two versions of the code:  
            
Original Code:  
{original_code}  

Final Optimized Code:  
{optimized_code}  

Output Structure:  
First provide a brief description of what the code is doing.  
Then provide a detailed comparison and highlight the specific optimizations or decisions made in the optimized version.  
Assign the **single most representative high-level optimization pattern** from the list above to the changes made in the optimized version. Or return "No Meaningful Change" if no meaningful change is made.
